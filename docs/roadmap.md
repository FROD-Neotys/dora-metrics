# Delivery Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundations
- Confirm stakeholders, success metrics, and data governance.

## Phase 2: Pipeline Implementation
- Build ingestion services and storage tables.
- Enable observability, retries, and schema validation.

- Expand to change failure rate and MTTR once data quality is proven.

## Phase 4: Visualization & Insights
- Publish dashboards, alerting, and stakeholder review cadences.
- Iterate on UX for drill-downs and self-service exploration.

## Phase 5: Validation & Expansion
- Run data quality audits and user acceptance tests.
- Prepare backlog for future metrics beyond DORA.

## Dependencies & Checkpoints
