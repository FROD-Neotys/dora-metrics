# Overview & Motivation

## Purpose
- Describe why R&D needs consolidated DORA metrics telemetry.

## Business Drivers
- Highlight leadership reporting needs, customer commitments, and operational SLAs.

## R&D Objectives
- Clarify engineering efficiency targets and experimentation cadence goals.

## Stakeholders
- Enumerate engineering leads, data platform owners, and product operations.

## Scope & Assumptions
- State which delivery pipelines, repositories, and environments are in scope today and note assumptions for future coverage.

## Success Criteria
- Define measurable adoption targets such as data completeness, dashboard availability, and decision-making impact.

## Future Metrics Considerations
- Note hooks required for adding non-DORA metrics without rework (e.g., flexibility in schemas, modular dashboards).
